Select objects and disintegrate them bit by bit.

Note:
- Large objects cause lag. I'm working on improving efficiency.
- Due to the scripting limitations of Teardown at the moment, the object does not disintegrate completely. Pieces that break off do not automatically add to the disintegration object list (again, scripting limitation). I am looking for a workaround for this.
