Select objects and disintegrate them bit by bit.


ABOUT THE LAG
- There is a much more efficient algorithm for disintegrating objects, but due to the current scripting limitations of Teardown, it's not possible to use right now. Once that scripting feature becomes possible, there should be a gigantic increase in performance (I'm estimating at least 10x performance).


INCOMPLETE DISINTEGRATION
- Due to another scripting limitation of Teardown (at the moment), the object does not disintegrate completely. Pieces that break off do not automatically get added to the disintegration object list (again, scripting limitation regarding the ability to the references of the broken off pieces). I am looking for a workaround for this.
